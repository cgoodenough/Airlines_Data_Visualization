# Airline Delay Dataset

## Dataset 

For this analysis, I chose to use the Flights data set. From the project details page "This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008.". The data can be obtained [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) with column descriptions. Supplemental data to convert airport and carrier codes can be found [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html).

## Resources Used
As always, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was an excellent resource for all sorts of methods. The [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/fabiendaniel/predicting-flight-delays-tutorial/notebook) by Fabian Daniel at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is amazing and I intend to work through that entire tutorial when I get a moment.

## Summary of Findings

### Market Share
Southwest airlines moved from second place to first in market share between the years 1998 and 2008. Their actual market share only increased by ~2%, while the other airlines' shares in the market were eroded by the entrance of many "new" airlines. Note: this may be due to more airlines voluntarily sharing their information in 2008 rather than a real entrance of 10 new airlines in the intervening decade.

### Overall On-Time records
There was not a big change in the worst on-time record between 1998 and 2008, although American Airlines has the dubious distinction of having the best record in 1998 and dropping to the worst by 2008. The data also show that Hawaii is a good destination if your goal is to arrive on time, with Hawaiian Air and Aloha Air having the best records in 2008.

### On-time vs small delay vs long delay
Southwest went from being tied for 3rd in 1998 to being the airline with the best record (least long elays relative to numbers of flights) of the largest carriers.

## Key Insights

Fly Southwest. Go to Hawaii. Overall, this dataset is rich and would allow for a lot of good analyis. For example: looking at which airports are best for on time arrivals, or which whether on-time odds are better for short or long flights. The 2008 data set would allow analysis of which delay causes result in the longest delays. The 1998 dataset does not contain this data.

Overall, while individual airlines' records changed over the decade, flight delays have not significantly increased or decreased.

## Apology

I want to apologize to my reviewer for the bare bones analysis contained here. My work got crazy starting at the beginning of the year and I was not able to devote the time to this project that I would like to have done. That said, this nanodegree program has provided me with a rock solid baseline in Data Analysis and I look forward to being able to apply all of the tools we explored in future projects.
